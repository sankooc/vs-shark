However, I believe that by leveraging the power of the open-source community, we can give this project the vitality it needs. That being said, I also realize that the current code structure might not be entirely optimal (since this is my first time working with Rust). Therefore, my idea is to define the protocols using a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and then generate the corresponding Rust code. This approach will not only lower the barrier to entry for contributors but also provide greater flexibility for future code refactoring.",-1)]))}const d=o(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,d as default};
