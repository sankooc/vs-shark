Initially, this project started as a way to pass time, but unexpectedly, after almost a year of work, it has grown significantly.  The project transitioned from TypeScript to Rust, and I gradually shifted from a JavaScript style to becoming more familiar with Rust.  Despite all this, this project has become one of the most fulfilling achievements Iâ€™ve had.

Moving forward, my plan for the project is as follows: Given the wide variety of communication protocols and protocol enumerations, I feel that the sustainability of the project cannot solely rely on my efforts.  However, I believe that by leveraging the power of the open-source community, we can give this project the vitality it needs.  That being said, I also realize that the current code structure might not be entirely optimal (since this is my first time working with Rust).  Therefore, my idea is to define the protocols using a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and then generate the corresponding Rust code.  This approach will not only lower the barrier to entry for contributors but also provide greater flexibility for future code refactoring.
