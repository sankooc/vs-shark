### **5. Future Directions**
- **Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)**: Official release in 2024, supports 320 MHz bandwidth, 16×16 MIMO.
- **Wi-Fi 6E**: Extended to 6 GHz band (more non-overlapping channels).
- **Wi-Fi Sensing**: Uses Wi-Fi signals for gesture recognition, intrusion detection, etc.

### **Summary**
The IEEE 802.11 protocol family ranges from legacy Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n) to modern high-speed networks (802.11ac/ax/be), with applications in IoT (802.11ah), vehicular communication (802.11p), and mesh networking (802.11s). For security, WPA3 is the latest standard, while Wi-Fi 6/7 drives higher throughput and lower latency.
